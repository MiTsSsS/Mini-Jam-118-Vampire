# Mini Jam 118 - Vampire
 The Mini Jam 118 had "Vampire" as a theme and "blood is lethal" as a limitation.  
 This game was supposed to be my entry for the jam but I went overboard with the idea and it took way more time than I anticipated xD  
 I am turning this project into a learning/testing project where I code features that I feel like implementing in a game in my spare time.
   
# Gameplay
This game is a tick based game where whenever the player moves, if they are in the range of enemy units, they move simultaneously.  
For now, the game goes on until the player dies and a random enemy chosen from a pool of enemies will keep spawning in random locations on the grid.

# Mechanics
- Move in the 4 directions
- Pick up and use items
- Attack enemies
