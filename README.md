# Mini Jam 118 - Vampire
 The Mini Jam 118 had "Vampire" as a theme and "blood is lethal" as a limitation.  
 This game was supposed to be my entry for the jam but I went overboard with the idea and it took way more time than I anticipated xD  
 I am turning this project into a learning/testing project where I code features that I feel like implementing in a game in my spare time.
   
# Gameplay
This game is a turn-based game.  
For now, the game goes on until the player dies.  
A random type of enemy chosen from a pool of enemies will keep spawning in random locations on the grid in a specified interval.

# Mechanics
- Move in the 4 directions
- Pick up, drop and use items
- Attack enemies
